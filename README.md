# PDF Text Extraction with ImageTextExtractor

The `ImageTextExtractor` script is a versatile tool for extracting text from PDF files. It utilizes computer vision techniques and text processing to convert PDF documents into machine-readable text data.

## Features

- **PDF to Images**: Convert PDF files into a list of images.
- **Image Preprocessing**: Preprocess images for better text extraction.
- **Text Extraction**: Extract text from processed images with language verification.
- **Confidence-Based Filtering**: Filter words based on confidence levels.
- **Text File Output**: Save the extracted text to a text file.

## Usage

You can use the `ImageTextExtractor` class by running the script and providing the input PDF file and output path. The script will convert the PDF to images, preprocess them, and extract text.

```python
from ImageTextExtractor import ImageTextExtractor

# Initialize the extractor
extractor = ImageTextExtractor()

# Define the input PDF file and output text file
pdf_file = 'input.pdf'
output_path = 'output.txt'

# Run the extraction process
extractor.run(pdf_file, output_path)

Dependencies
The script relies on the following libraries:

cv2 (OpenCV)
PIL (Pillow)
pytesseract
langdetect
os
pdf2image
numpy

You can install these dependencies using pip:
pip install opencv-python-headless pillow pytesseract langdetect pdf2image numpy
```
